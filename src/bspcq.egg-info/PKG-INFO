# bspcq, q for query

### A `bspc` analyzer (utility for [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm))

This is a small program that prints a user friendly, visual representation, of
your current `bsp` tree.

The aim is to assist in using `bspwm` so new users have an easier time getting
into tiling window managers, and have some toys to play with.

It's essentially the same as
running:
```sh
bspc query -M -m <monitor-name> | jq
```

Except there are fewer parameters, a less complex syntax to remember and an
intuitive visual.

## Installation

```sh
python -m pip install bspcq
```

## Usage

```sh
# Prints the full tree, including output from all monitors.
bspcq
```

```sh
# Provides a simpler view, perfect for finding window class names.
bspcq -s
```

```sh
# Grabs info on all nodes that belong to the specified domain.
bspcq -M/D/N
```

```sh
# Passes through a query to `bspc query` and prints our tree.
bspcq -m/d/n <monitor/desktop/node-identifier>
```

## Plans
My goals currently are to:
 - Align `bspcq` as closely as possible with `bspc query`. I would like for
 `bspcq` to behave almost identically to `bspc query` - it just adds a visual
 element.
 - Remain as lean as possible. A nice-to-have feature would be 0 reliance on
 external libraries, so I'd like to remove `rich` and implement a way to display
 the `tree` myself.

This was just an afternoon project that's turning into a week long project since
it's quite a lot of fun!
